                    Smallholder farmers are a crucial part of the food value chain in India, as well as a critical element of the global food system. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new risks that threaten livelihoods as well as food security.India is home to about 120
                    million smallholder farmers who contribute over 40% of the country’s grain production, and over half of its fruits, vegetables, oilseeds and other crops. Much of the global share of food staples such as rice and wheat come from India,
                    and almost half of the population in India depends on agriculture for their livelihood.Every year, Indian farmers face risks such as low rainfall, price volatility and rising debts. But risks from the COVID-19 pandemic are putting
                    new challenges in front of a sector that is already under threat.The nationwide lockdown came at an unfortunate time for farmers, as it was the harvest season for the rabi (winter) crop. The lockdown created both a shortage of labor
                    and equipment - migrant laborers in India usually move to rural areas during harvest, and smallholder farmers often rent harvesting equipment as this is cheaper than purchasing it.Consequently, farmers have not been able to harvest
                    their bumper crops of cereal and oilseed harvest this season. In some places the crops have been abandoned, while in others the harvest is coming more than a month late, in hand with limited and more expense labor.</br>In
                    addition, it was estimated that although India’s food bank had more than three times the minimum operational buffer in stock, supply and access is a critical issue. Long supply chains have been severely affected, especially at the
                    beginning of the lockdown when transport was restricted. Drivers abandoned trucks full of produce in the middle of interstate highways. Markets eventually started running short of supplies, owing to food rotting in transit or never
                    making it to point of sale. ITC’s Agribusiness team has been responding to the situation by using its digital advisory application "e-choupal” to procure produce. E-choupal provides information to farmers about market demand of their
                    produce, market prices etc. to allow them to make well-informed decisions and fetch competitive prices in the markets.</br>
                    In these challenging times, when regular transport and markets have not been functioning, ITC utilized their already existing e-choupal infrastructure and network to procure farm produce directly from farmer locations, and introduced supply chain interventions
                    like multi- point rake movements, and coastal container movements to ensure uninterrupted movement of produce.In the first few days of the lockdown, consumers resorted to panic buying and hoarding essentials such as flour, rice, sugar
                    and oil. Prices of sugar rose in cities where supplies were limited and fell in other places due to over-supply. Gradually, with logistical restrictions, markets fell short of supplies and the prices of these commodities increased.
                    But the farmgate prices of fruit, vegetables, milk, meat and poultry in India have crashed because of lower demand Another issue that is cause for concern is the availability and access to seeds, fertilizers and pesticides for the
                    next crop season. Post the rabi harvest in April, farmers prepare for the next (kharif) season in May. However, the COVID-19 induced disruptions have reduced production capacity for farm inputs and have led to an increase in price,
                    making these resources inaccessible to smallholder and marginal farmers in the country.While large landholding farmers and businesses may be able to weather these shocks, they put enormous pressure on smallholders who work with limited
                    resources and income. Resuming business operations will be key to ensuring harvest security in the coming season.

                    The pandemic has also highlighted the potential public health crisis awaiting rural India and farming communities. Basic preventive measures such as regular handwashing, social distancing and self-isolation pose a unique challenge for rural communities.
                    In a country which is already water-scarce, and where there is irregular water supply in many areas both rural and urban, repeated handwashing is a luxury that cannot be put into practice. In addition, social distancing and isolation
                    are a huge challenge for farming communities who rely on daily labor and wages for their subsistence. As we adjust to a new normal and “business as unusual”, it is imperative for a predominantly agrarian country like India to leverage
                    the lessons from the pandemic and the severe impacts it has had on the farming community.</br>
                    The key lessons are:</br>
                    1.Long food supply chains involving multiple stakeholders and entities are clearly vulnerable to shocks such as the pandemic. Mapping and optimizing supply chains will be key for future resilience.</br>
                    2.Building a resilient food system is not about production, but also about ensuring access to nutritious food to people in times of crisis. </br>
                    3.Smallholder farmers are highly vulnerable to crisis as a result of their limited access to resources, credit and basic healthcare facilities. Measures will need to be taken by governments and businesses to protect the community.</br>
                    Some of the issues highlighted above need urgent attention since they have medium to long term implications on India’s food system. Also, the effects could add up to impact the global food system although it seems for now that the global food system is
                    coping well with the crisis through swapping sources and rerouting supplies. The threat of the coronavirus for India is far from over, but the leaders realize the need for the economy to start functioning. Yet, it is now understood
                    that business-as-usual is a thing of the past. As we build the “new normal”, we will need to be innovative in our thinking, and ensure that our efforts to rebuild are sensitive to the needs and circumstances of smallholder farmers.
                    In this way we can protect and support the resilience of the local food supply, while also taking steps to ensure future systemic shocks can be handled quickly and effectively.

                    The food supply chain is a network that connects an agricultural system (the farm) with the consumer's table, including pro-cesses such as manufacturing, packaging, distribution, and storage Initially, the announcements of social isolation made people
                    go to the supply centers and generate a shortage of some products, despite this, the food supply has stabilized because it is one of the systems that must be maintained to ensure food security. One of FAO's roles is to promote that
                    food value chains are not interrupted and continue to operate. Thus, despite the restrictions that governments have imposed on the mobility of labor in agricultural systems, although with some problems, the supply of basic necessities
                    is normally assured. The situation is different when it comes to goods that are imported or exported; due to the closure of borders, international trade was interrupted, although after having defined security protocols to avoid the
                    spread of the virus, trade stabilized. This may be temporary; it depends on what countries are doing to stop the spread of the virus.</br>
                    Part of the food supply system, are the social programs that some countries, mainly Latin America, have to feed millions of families and children with limited economic resources. This supply system is being served in different ways:</br>
                    1.Delivery of food rations of basic necessities (for example, Indonesia and Taiwan).</br>
                    2.Economic allocation equivalent to the cost of food rations of basic necessity (for example, Peru, Japan, and Singapore).

                    Demand implies the willingness and ability of consumers to pay money for a particular good or service, during any particular period (Gottheil, 2013). The demand for food has decreased due to uncertainty and the reduction of people's spending capacity,
                    although this decrease is still slight; the situation could worsen if the pandemic continues for a long time, due to reduced income and job losses (FAO, 2020b). Since China represents an important market in world trade and where the
                    COVID-19 disease started, his experience shows an increase in online demand in the food and beverage sector, due to quarantine policies (FAO, 2020a). In situations like these, where a virus spreads on contact, contactless delivery
                    services become preferred by consumers. For example, those who use drones for the product delivery.

                    A second emerging issue concerns labour availability in the agri-food sector. Labour has been suddenly restricted in many regions due to quarantine measures and loss of workforce from COVID-19 deaths and serious illness. There have been substantial restrictions
                    on international labour movements and worker programs that are critical to agricultural production in some sectors or that have caused bottlenecks. Anecdotally, this seems particularly severe in horticulture, livestock production systems,
                    and processing but also for planting and harvesting of crops that are relatively labour-intensive. The timing of labour needs is often inflexible for seasonally produced foods. Resolving these labour shortages and designing working
                    conditions that are safe for workers and the community, is of critical importance in order to secure future growing seasons and avoid disastrous consequences for future food security and supply.</br>
                    If COVID-19 is not contained, implying that free and safe movement of agri-food workers will not be attainable for the foreseeable future, how will our agricultural and food systems cope with this loss? Will emergency measures, such as recruiting temporary
                    domestic volunteers or chartering special flights and paying workers during quarantines be sufficient? Can we make workers safer given that many are in dormitory style housing and/or work on assembly lines that are incompatible with
                    maintaining physical distancing? If workers cannot be safe, and be perceived to be so, while the virus is circulating in the community, what will the effects on food systems be? Can all regions fill their labour shortages sufficiently?
                    What different approaches to this problem might there be? Will there be major and permanent changes in international agri-food labour availability and movements and, if so, how might agricultural systems adapt?

                    The COVID-19 pandemic is having an impact on international relationships far beyond the agri-food sector's labour force. This includes announcements of export restrictions across several countries that limit global agri-food trade and market access (see
                    for example Laborde and IFPRI, 2020). The agri-food sector is highly connected internationally. Ports that shut down or reduce activity, vastly reduced freight capacity on commercial flights for agricultural goods, and other broad
                    global supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 crisis have the potential to limit critical access to agricultural inputs and markets. This may negatively impact agricultural productivity for current and future seasons. The suddenness
                    and severity of these shutdowns leave little scope for identifying suitable domestic substitutes in the short term but may spur less reliance on global agri-food value chains in the future. Some nations are also exploring more domestic
                    ‘food sovereignty’ in order to address emerging domestic food security concerns due to COVID-19. These actions have serious implications for our current globalized agri-food trading system and is potentially one of the most important
                    impacts on the current food system.

                    COVID-19 is disrupting some activities in agriculture and supply chains. Preliminary reports show that the non-availability of migrant labor is interrupting some harvesting activities, particularly in northwest India where wheat and pulses are being harvested.
                    There are disruptions in supply chains because of transportation problems and other issues. Prices have declined for wheat, vegetables, and other crops, yet consumers are often paying more. Media reports show that the closure of hotels,
                    restaurants, sweet shops, and tea shops during the lockdown is already depressing milk sales. Meanwhile, poultry farmers have been badly hit due to misinformation, particularly on social media, that chicken are the carriers of COVID-19.</br>
                    Here are some measures are required to keep the agricultural sector and supply chains working smoothly:</br>
                    1.The government has correctly issued lockdown guidelines that exempt farm operations and supply chains. But implementation problems leading to labor shortages and falling prices should be rectified.</br>
                    2. Keeping supply chains functioning well is crucial to food security. It should be noted that 2 to 3 million deaths in the Bengal famine of 1943 were due to food supply disruptions—not a lack of food availability.</br>
                    3.Farm populations must be protected from the coronavirus to the extent possible by testing and practicing social distancing.</br>
                    4.Farmers must have continued access to markets. This can be a mix of private markets and government procurement.</br>
                    5.Small poultry and dairy farmers need more targeted help, as their pandemic-related input supply and market-accessproblems are urgent.</br>
