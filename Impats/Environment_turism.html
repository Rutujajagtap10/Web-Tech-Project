                    As industries, transportation and companies have closed down, it has brought a sudden drop of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. Compared with this time of last year, levels of air pollution in Ney York has reduced by nearly 50% because of measures taken
                    to control the virus (Henriques, 2020). It was estimated that nearly 50% reduction of N2O and CO occurred due to the shutdown of heavy industries in China (Caine, 2020). Also, emission of NO₂ is one of the key indicators of global
                    economic activities, which indicates a sign of reduction in many countries (e.g., US, Canada, China, India, Italy, Brazil etc.) due to the recent shut down (Biswal et al., 2020; Ghosh, 2020; Saadat et al., 2020; Somani et al., 2020).
                    Usually, NO2 is emitted from the burning of fossil fuels, 80% of which comes from motor vehicle exhaust (USEPA, 2016). It is reported that NO2 causes acid rain with the interaction of O2 and H2O, and several respiratory diseases suffered
                    by humans (USEPA, 2016). The European Environmental Agency (EEA) predicted that, because of the COVID-19 lockdown, NO2 emission dropped from 30-60% in many European cities including Barcelona, Madrid, Milan, Rome and Paris (EEA, 2020).
                    In the US NO2 declined 25.5% during the COVID-19 period compared to previous years (Berman and Edisu, 2020). The level of NO2 demonstrated a reduction across Ontario (Canada) and found to be reduced from 4.5 ppb to 1 ppb (Adams, 2020).
                    Up to 54.3% decrease of NO2 was observed in Sao Paulo of Brazil (Nakada and Urban, 2020). It was also stated that, the levels of NO2 and PM2.5 reduced by almost 70% in Delhi, the capital of India (Thiessen, 2020). Overall, 46% and
                    50% reduction of PM2.5 and PM10 respectively, was reported in India during the nationwide lockdown (IEP, 2020). Overall, much less consumption of fossil fuels lessens the GHGs emission, which helps to combat against global climate
                    change. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), oil demand has dropped 435,000 barrels globally in the first three months of 2020, compared to the same period of last year (IEA, 2020). Besides, global coal consumption is
                    also reduced because of less energy demand during the lockdown period (Figure 5). It is reported that, coal-based power generation reduced 26% in India with 19% reduction of total power generation after lockdown (CREA, 2020). Again,
                    China, the highest coal consumer in the world, dropped 36% compared to same time of the preceding year (early February to mid-march) (CREA, 2020; Ghosh, 2020). According to UK based climate science and policy website Carbon Brief,
                    recent crisis of COVID-19 reduces 25% CO2 emission in China, and nonetheless below the normal limit more than two months after the country entered lockdown (Evans, 2020). They also projected that, the pandemic could cut 1,600 metric
                    tons of CO2, equivalent to above 4% of the global total in 2019 (Evans, 2020).

                <h2>1.2 Reduction of water pollution.</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="content p">
                <p>
                    Water pollution is a common phenomenon of a developing country like India, and Bangladesh, where domestic and industrial wastes are dumped into rivers without treatment (Islam and Azam, 2015; Islam and Huda, 2016; Bodrud-Doza et al., 2020; Yunus et al.,
                    2020). During the lockdown period, the major industrial sources of pollution have shrunk or completely stopped, which helped to reduce the pollution load (Yunus et al., 2020). For instance, the river Ganga and Yamuna have reached a
                    significant level of purity due to the absence of industrial pollution on the days of lockdown in India. It is found that, among the 36 real-time monitoring stations of river Ganga, water from 27 stations met the permissible limit
                    (Singhal and Matto, 2020). This improvement of water quality at Haridwar and Rishikesh was ascribed to the sudden drop of the number of visitors and 500% reduction of sewage and industrial effluents (Singhal and Matto, 2020; Somani
                    et al., 2020). According to the real-time water quality monitoring data of the Uttarakhand Pollution Control Board (UPCB, 2020) of India, physicochemical parameters i.e, pH (7.4–7.8), dissolved oxygen (DO) (9.4–10.6 mg/L), biochemical
                    oxygen demand (BOD) (0.6–1.2 mg/L) and total coliform (40–90 MPN/100 mL) of the river Ganga was found within the surface water quality standard of India. Except total coliform in some monitoring stations, all others parameters even
                    meet the national drinking water quality standard, which can be used without conventional treatment but after disinfection (Class A) (BIS, 2012). It is also found that, the concentration of pH, electric conductivity (EC), DO, BOD and
                    chemical oxygen demand (COD) has reduced almost 1–10%, 33–66%, 45–90%, and 33–82% respectively in different monitoring stations during the lockdown in comparison to the pre-lockdown period (Arif et al., 2020). Moreover, due to imposed
                    a ban of public gathering, number of tourists and water activities were reduced in many places (Cripps, 2020; Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020). It is reported that, due to the lockdown of COVID-19, the Grand Canal of Italy turned
                    clear, and reappearances of many aquatic species (Clifford, 2020). Water pollution are also reduced in the beach areas of Bangladesh, Malaysia, Thailand, Maldives, and Indonesia (Kundu, 2020; Rahman, 2020). Jribi et al. (2020) reported
                    that, due to the COVID-19 lockdown, the amount of food waste is reduced in Tunisia, which ultimately reduces soil and water pollution. However, the amount of industrial water consumption is also reduced, especially from the textile
                    sector around the glove (Cooper, 2020). Usually, huge amount of solid trashes is generated from construction and manufacturing process responsible for water and soil pollution, also reduced. Moreover, owing to the reduction of export-import
                    business, the movement of merchant ship and other vessels are reduced globally, which also reduces emission as well as marine pollution.

                <p>
                    Noise pollution is the elevated levels of sound, generated from different human activities (e.g., machines, vehicles, construction work), which may lead to adverse effects in human and other living organisms (Goines and Hagler, 2007; Zambrano-Monserrate
                    et al., 2020). Usually, noise negatively effects on physiological health, along with cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, and sleep shortness of human (Kerns et al., 2018). It is reported that, globally around 360 million people
                    are prone to hearing loss due to noise pollution (Sims, 2020). World Health Organization predicted that in Europe alone, over 100 million people are exposed to high noise levels, above the recommended limit (WHO, 2012). Moreover, anthropogenic
                    noise pollution has adverse impacts on wildlife through the changing balance in predator and prey detection and avoidance. Unwanted noise also negatively effects on the invertebrates, that help to control environmental processes which
                    are vital for the balance of the ecosystem (Solan et al., 2016). However, the quarantine and lockdown measures mandate that people stay at home and reduced economic activities and communication worldwide, which ultimately reduced noise
                    level in most cities (Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020). For instance, noise level of Delhi the capital of India, is reduced drastically around 40–50% in the recent lockdown period (Somani et al., 2020). Due to reduction of vehicle
                    movement during the lockdown period, the noise levels of Govindpuri metro station (Delhi) is reduced 50–60 dB, from 100 dB (Gandhiok and Ibra, 2020). According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB, 2020) of India, noise level
                    of residential area of Delhi is reduced 55 dB (daytime) and 45 dB (night) to 40 dB (daytime) and 30 dB (night) respectively. As a result, city dwellers are now enjoying the chirping of birds, which usually ranges from 40-50 dB (Gandhiok
                    and Ibra, 2020). Moreover, due to travel restrictions, the number of flights and vehicular movements have drastically reduced around the world, which have ultimately reduced the level of noise pollution. For example, in Germany passenger
                    air travel has been slashed by over 90%, car traffic has dropped by >50% and trains are running 25% than the usual rates (Sims, 2020). Overall, COVID-19 lockdown, and lessens of economic activities reduced the noise pollution around
                    the globe.

                    Over the past few years, tourism sector has witnessed a remarkable growth because of technological advancements and transport networks; which contribute significantly to global gross domestic product (GDP) (Lenzen et al., 2018). It is estimated that the
                    tourism industry is responsible for 8% of global GHGs emission (Lenzen et al., 2018). However, the places of natural beauty (e.g., beaches, islands, national park, mountains, desert and mangroves) are usually attracting the tourists,
                    and make a huge harsh. To facilitate and accommodate them, lots of hotels, motel, restaurant, bar and market are built, which consume lots of energy and other natural resources (Pereira et al., 2017). For instance, Puig et al. (2017)
                    calculated the carbon footprint of coastland hotel services of Spain and reported electricity and fuels consumption take a key role, and 2-star hotels have the highest carbon emissions. Moreover, visitors dump various wastes which
                    impair natural beauty and create ecological imbalance (Islam and Bhuiyan, 2018). Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and local restrictions, the number of tourists have reduced in the tourist spots around the world (Zambrano-Monserrate
                    et al., 2020). For instance, Phuket, Thailand's most popular tourist's destination goes into lockdown on April 9, 2020, due to the surge of Covid-19, where an average 5,452 visitors visit per day (Cripps, 2020). Similarly, local administration
                    imposed a ban on public gathering and tourist arrivals at Cox's Bazar sea beach, known as the longest unbroken natural sand sea beach in the world. As a result of restriction, the color of sea water is changed, which usually remain
                    turbid because of swimming, bathing, playing and riding motorized boats (Rahman, 2020). Nature gets a time to assimilate human annoyance, and due to pollution reduction recently returning of dolphins was reported in the coast of Bay
                    of Bengal (Bangladesh) and canals, waterways, and ports of Venice (Italy) after a long decade (Rahman, 2020; Kundu, 2020).

                    Since the outbreak of COVID-19, medical waste generation is increased globally, which is a major threat to public health and environment. For sample collection of the suspected COVID-19 patients, diagnosis, treatment of huge number of patients, and disinfection
                    purpose lots of infectious and biomedical wastes are generated from hospitals (Somani et al., 2020; Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020). For instance, Wuhan in China produced more than 240 metric tons of medical wastes every day during
                    the time of the outbreak (Saadat et al., 2020), which is almost 190 m tonnes higher than the normal time (Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020). Again, in the city of Ahmedabad of India, the amount of medical waste generation is increased
                    from 550-600 kg/day to around 1000 kg/day at the time of the first phase of lockdown (Somani et al., 2020). Around 206 m tonnes of medical waste are generated per day in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh because of COVID-19 (Rahman
                    et al., 2020). Also other cities like Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Hanoi, and Bangkok experienced similar increases, producing 154–280 m tonnes more medical waste per day than before the pandemic (ADB, 2020). Such a sudden rise of hazardous
                    waste, and their proper management has become a significant challenge to the local waste management authorities. According to the recent published literature, it is reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can exist a day on cardboard, and
                    up to 3 days on plastics and stainless steel (Van-Doremalen et al., 2020). So, waste generated from the hospitals (e.g., needles, syringes, bandage, mask, gloves, used tissue, and discarded medicines etc.) should be managed properly,
                    to reduce further infection and environmental pollution, which is now a matter of concern globally.

                    To protect from the viral infection, presently peoples are using face mask, hand gloves and other safety equipment, which increase the amount of healthcare waste. It is reported that, in USA, trash amount has been increasing due to increased PPE use at
                    the domestic level (Calma, 2020). Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the production and use of plastic based PPE is increased worldwide (Singh et al., 2020). For instance, China increased the daily production of medical masks to 14.8
                    million since from February 2020, which is much higher than before (Fadare and Okoffo, 2020). However, due to lack of knowledge about infectious waste management, most people dump these (e.g., face mask, hand gloves etc.) in open places
                    and in some cases with household wastes (Rahman et al., 2020). Such haphazard dumping of these trashes creates clogging in water ways and worsens environmental pollution (Singh et al., 2020; Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020). It is
                    reported that, face mask and other plastic based protective equipment are the potential source of microplastic fibers in the environment (Fadare and Okoffo, 2020). Usually, Polypropylene is used to make N-95 masks, and Tyvek for protective
                    suits, gloves, and medical face shields, which can persist for a long time and release dioxin and toxic elements to the environment (Singh et al., 2020). Though, experts and responsible authorities suggest for the proper disposal and
                    segregation of household organic waste and plastic based protective equipment (hazardous medical waste), but mixing up these wastes increases the risk of disease transmission, and exposure to the virus of waste workers (Ma et al.,
                    2020; Somani et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020).

                    Increase of municipal waste (both organic and inorganic) generation has direct and indirect effects on environment like air, water and soil pollution (Islam et al., 2016). Due to the pandemic, quarantine policies established in many countries have led
                    to an increase in the demand of online shopping for home delivery, which ultimately increase the amount of household wastes from shipped package materials (Somani et al., 2020; Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020). However, waste recycling
                    is an effective way to prevent pollution, save energy, and conserve natural resources (Ma et al., 2019). But, due to the pandemic many countries postponed the waste recycling activities to reduce the transmission of viral infection.
                    For instance, USA restricted recycling programs in many cities (nearly 46%), as government worried about the risk of COVID-19 spreading in recycling facilities (Somani et al., 2020). United Kingdom, Italy, and other European countries
                    also prohibited infected residents from sorting their waste (Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020). Overall, due to disruption of routine municipal waste management, waste recovery and recycling activities, increasing the landfilling and

                    Recently, huge amount of disinfectants is applied into roads, commercial, and residential areas to exterminate SARS-CoV-2 virus. Such extensive use of disinfectants may kill non-targeted beneficial species, which may create ecological imbalance (Islam
                    and Bhuiyan, 2016). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in the COVID-19 patient's faeces and also from municipal wastewater in many countries including Australia, India, Sweden, Netherlands and USA (Ahmed et al., 2020; Nghiem et
                    al., 2020; Mallapaty, 2020). So, additional measures in wastewater treatment are essential, which is challenging for developing countries like Bangladesh, where municipal wastewater is drained into nearby aquatic bodies and rivers
                    without treatment (Islam and Azam, 2015; Rahman and Islam, 2016). China has already strengthened the disinfection process (increased use of chlorine) to prevent SARS-CoV-2 virus spreading through the wastewater. But, the excessive
                    use of chlorine in water could generate harmful by-product (Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020).

                    Globally, travel and tourism are the significant contributors to a leading sector for job creation, socio-economic and cultural development worldwide (McCabe and Qiao, 2020). In many cities, regions, and countries, tourism plays a critical role as a strategic
                    pillar of the economy's GDP. The tourism and leisure industry plays a vital role in economic activities and customer satisfaction, but it has also become the most vulnerable industry member (Ma et al., 2020). This industry always experiences
                    the hardiest-hits of various diseases, epidemics, seasonal influenza, and global pandemics. The tourism industry encounters the massive adverse consequences of the "black swan" major crisis events, including the global financial crunch
                    in 1997 and 2008, the SARS epidemic in 2003, various social unrests, and earthquakes (Lee and Chen, 2021). The emergence of the deadliest viral disease has affected all economic sectors and overwhelmed tourists and customers' satisfaction.
                    Economic activities and business services are contingent on expert forecasts that are based on traditional methods. It could be outdated and ineffective to handle global crisis events (Yu et al., 2020; Wang, 2009; Page et al., 2011).
                    Accurate forecasting methods for the academic world and business operations need the needful response to the COVID-19 impacts. Since late December 2019, the advent of the present pandemic COVID-19 has developed unprecedented global
                    health crises, social emergencies, and profound adverse consequences on the global economy. The current pandemic COVID-19 has resulted in global challenges, renewable energy, carbon emission, economic and healthcare crises, and posed

                    affected the business firms' sustainable performance, and the CEO role became critical to take innovative decisions to revive economic gains (Mubeen et al., 2020). Social media platforms have provided information to various stakeholders

                    most vulnerable industries worldwide. The leisure, travel, and inbound tourism activities designated a steeper drop causing 2.86 trillion US dollars losses that made up 50% plus loss in revenues. In the first stage, this research study
                    discovers the significance and settings of the current pandemic COVID-19 (Wut et al., 2021). The study explores how innovation and change might contribute to the tourism and leisure industry's revitalization to the next normal (Cuomo
