                    People in Japan have also started to express worry that the government is not doing enough to contain the crisis. Chris, who recently moved to Japan from Europe, has spoken to Medical News Today. He told us what the state of emergency looked like in Yokohama,
                    where he currently lives.“Effectively, the government has requested that businesses and schools close where possible or promote [working from home] … but it can only request, it can’t actually make it a law,” Chris told us.

                    Other European countries have put in place less stringent measures. For instance, in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a lockdown on March 23, though the measures have been less stringent than in other countries. Some, however,
                    relish the relative freedom that Britain’s more relaxed pandemic advice has afforded. Harry, who lives in Brighton, U.K., told MNT: “Britain’s less rigid approach to the lockdown compared to other European countries is crucial to maintaining
                    my [mental] as well as physical health. As it is, I [can] stay active, get sunlight and air, and avoid being stuck in the same place all day.” At the same time, practitioners in the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS) have been bracing
                    for a severe strain on the NHS’s resources, as hospitals are cracking under the pressure of increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases. Other European countries, such as Sweden, which have reported fewer cases of COVID-19 overall, have fewer
                    and much less restrictive measures in place. People who live in Sweden have been staying more or less put, mostly following their own judgment. Simona, based in Malmö, told MNT that “Sweden does not impose any quarantine [measures],
                    just [physical] distancing, but I have been sort of — partially — self-isolating together with my partner.”

                    In the February 2020 jobs report, which reflected the employment situation before lockdowns began, 1.28 million Americans were classed as "permanent job losers". In August, that number was at 3.41 million, and in September it rose to 3.75 million. "Temporary
                    layoffs", meanwhile, decreased, suggesting that some job losses originally understood as "temporary" had now become permanent. On May 8, 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 20.5 million nonfarm jobs were lost and the
                    unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent in April. This followed reports of weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance that increased from a typical level of around 200,000 per week through early March, to 3.3 million the week
                    of March 21, a peak of 6.9 million (March 28), and declines each week thereafter to 3.0 million the week of May 9. A total of 36.5 million filed for unemployment insurance from March 21 to May 9. The Congressional Budget Office estimated
                    that costs for unemployment insurance claims were $49 billion in April 2020, versus $3 billion in April 2019. An estimated $27 billion of the increase was due to the $600/week increase in unemployment benefits due to the CARES Act.
                    On May 20, 2021, the Labor Department reported that there had been only 444,000 unemployment claims during the previous week, the lowest number since the beginning of the pandemic. In May 2020, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
                    summarized the ongoing and expected economic impact: The unemployment rate increased from 3.5% in February to 14.7% in April 2020, representing a decline of more than 25 million people employed, plus another 8 million persons that
                    exited the labor force.

                    the leading European economies after Germany and France. The country has a significant value in the export of goods and services. The country has shown a significant rise in manufacturing operations, including food & beverage, machinery
                    and equipment, and chemicals. The monetary policy, structural reforms and economic conditions, have encouraged exports and investment in the country. However, global uncertainties and the impacts of social conflicts assessed on activity
                    in 2018. Consumption and growth will benefit from a boost in households' purchasing power. The GDP growth is expected to stay nearly 1.3% in 2019-20 in France as per OECD. Moreover, France has more than 18,000 companies and over 380,000
                    employees in the manufacturing sector. The country's agri-food industry is the major contributor in the country economy with $170 billion revenue in 2017. France is facing a major challenge of recession concerning the effect of COVID-19
                    pandemic. It has affected the whole production capability of the country coupled with a slowdown in global demand, and concerns regarding the availability of raw material. As a result, the manufacturing and other industries in the
                    country have been temporarily shut down their industrial operations. According to the WHO, France recorded 15,821 confirmed cases of COVID-19 till 23, March 2020 and 674 mortalities due to COVID-19 in the country. The fear regarding
                    businesses and employment have rapidly increased since February in France. In France, economic uncertainty be seen to have grown more abruptly than concerns relating to the level of risk posed by the coronavirus.

                    The pandemic arrived with devastating effects. Data from the Ministry of Economy show a negative balance of more than 1 million formal jobs between March and April. In total, there was an increase of 4.9 million in the numbers of unemployed persons. Furthermore,
                    until May 26, working hours and wages were reduced for 8.1 million workers under a special programme for the formal labour market.1 More than half of these labour agreements were for the complete suspension of employment contracts.The
                    official unemployment rate in May was 10.1%, slightly smaller than in January and February. However, if we also take into account the contingent of people who couldn’t search for a job specifically due to the pandemic (and the social
                    distancing policies),2 that number rises to 25.4%. If there had not been any government assistance whatsoever, household per capita income would have dropped by R$66 (5.0%) and the poverty rate would have risen from 18.7 to 21.9% of
                    the population (Barbosa and Prates 2020).The Emergency Basic (EBI) Income Programme eased the impact on the average income of informal workers and the poorest families. It is an unconditional cash transfer of 600 BRL, initially for
                    3 months, which was instituted in by the federal law No. 13.982/2020. However, situations of poverty involve a multitude of dimensions not fully captured solely by income: bad housing conditions, lack of access to public services,
                    more exposure to violence and crime, insecure jobs, etc. These dimensions are not tackled by a short-term cash transfer. And the money received certainly does not make up for the deaths from COVID-19, greater among the poorest. In
                    other words, poverty rates, measured as income insufficiency, become less correlated to and an inadequate proxy for the real multidimensional poverty. We should also heed warning of the transient or temporary nature of these transfers:
                    after the emergency benefit ends, we immediately return to the desolate scenario created by the pandemic.

                    Background. Spain has been one of the countries most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the first confirmed case was reported on January 31, 2020, there have been over 405,000 cases and 28,000 deaths in Spain. The economic and social impact is without
                    precedent.The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Since then, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread worldwide, infecting over 24 million people and causing over 825,000 deaths worldwide as of August 27,
                    2020. This virus has caused significantly more infections and deaths, compared with previous outbreaks of other coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. The World Health Organization
                    declared a global COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020, and to date has been unable to predict the duration of the pandemic. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Spain was reported on January 31, 2020, when a German tourist tested
                    positive in the Spanish Canary Islands. However, this was an isolated imported case. It was not until February 24 when Spain confirmed several new COVID-19 cases related to a recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the north of Italy. Since
                    that date, the number of COVID-19 cases grew exponentially in Spain so that by March 30, 2020, there were over 85,199 confirmed cases, 16,780 recoveries, and the staggering figure of 7424 deaths, according to the official numbers.
                    On March 25, 2020, the death toll attributed to COVID-19 in Spain surpassed that of mainland China, and it was only surpassed by the death toll in Italy. The economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain is without precedent.
                    To combat the pandemic, the Spanish Government implemented a series of social distancing and mobility restriction measures. First, all classes at all educational levels were cancelled in the main hot spots of the disease on March 10,
                    in the Basque Country and on March 11, 2020, in the Madrid and La Rioja regions. All direct flights from Italy to Spain were cancelled on March 10. On March 12, the Catalan Government quarantined four municipalities that were particularly
                    affected by the virus. On March 13, the Government of Spain declared a state of emergency for 2 weeks across the entire country. Since the state of emergency was established, all schools and university classes were cancelled, large-scale
                    events and nonessential travel were forbidden, and workers were encouraged to tele-work. Despite these efforts, the daily growth rate in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases continued to grow. Thus, on March 30, new mobility restriction
                    and social distancing measures were implemented; all nonessential labor activity was to be interrupted for a 2-week period. Moreover, the Spanish Government extended the state of emergency first until April 11 and then renewed on a
                    biweekly basis until June 21. Although these interventions put a halt to the normal daily lives of most people in Spain, their impact on people’s economic, physical, and mental well-being were unknown at the time, as was the actual
                    prevalence of the disease.

                    The COVID-19 pandemic had a deep impact on the Canadian economy, leading it into a recession. The governments' social distancing rules had the effect of limiting economic activity in the country. ... But despite these efforts, Canada's unemployment rate
                    was 13.5% in May 2020, the highest it has been since 1976. Initially, fast casual restaurants such as Starbucks and Tim Hortons maintained service, but suspended the allowable use of reusable cups by patrons. Tim Hortons simultaneously
                    altered its popular "Roll up the Rim to Win" promotion to exclude physical cups (the chain had already announced its intent to increase its use of digital components for the promotion in an effort to combat litter).In compliance with
                    or ahead of local mandates, some national restaurant chains (including those aforementioned) have since suspended in-store dining and seating, in favour of take-out and delivery service only. Although McDonald's Canada and Wendy's
                    Canada have both decided to close their dining rooms entirely at most locations, and only offer drive-through and delivery.[Shopify cancelled its Shopify Unite conference, which was scheduled to occur from 6 to 9 May in Toronto. Tourist
                    sites such as the CN Tower were closed or limited in capacity due to the pandemic.Many summer festivals and events were cancelled including the Canadian National Exhibition and Canadian International Air Show,Calgary Stampede, Celebration
                    of Light fireworks festival, and Pacific National Exhibition.Pride events planned to take place across the country were changed to take place virtually. In April 2020, there were concerns afoot that, because of the federal closure
                    of all external borders, the farm sector would have difficulty with a labour shortfall, as seasonal farm workers would be absent. In May, many agricultural producers were worried about going bankrupt,[4] this in spite of the announcement
                    on 5 May of a $252 million federal ag subsidy programme.The Canadian Federation of Agriculture had called one week earlier for a $2.6 billion subsidy but were disappointed.
