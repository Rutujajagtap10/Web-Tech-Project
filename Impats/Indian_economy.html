                    The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in India has been largely disruptive. India's growth in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020 went down to 3.1% according to the Ministry of Statistics. The Chief Economic Adviser to the Government of
                    India said that this drop is mainly due to the coronavirus pandemic effect on the Indian economy. Notably India had also been witnessing a pre-pandemic slowdown, and according to the World Bank, the current pandemic has "magnified
                    pre-existing risks to India's economic outlook". The World Bank and rating agencies had initially revised India's growth for FY2021 with the lowest figures India has seen in three decades since India's economic liberalization in the
                    1990s. However, after the announcement of the economic package in mid-May, India's GDP estimates were downgraded even more to negative figures, signalling a deep recession. (The ratings of over 30 countries have been downgraded during
                    this period.) On 26 May, CRISIL announced that this will perhaps be India's worst recession since independence. State Bank of India research estimates a contraction of over 40% in the GDP in Q1. The contraction will not be uniform,
                    rather it will differ according to various parameters such as state and sector. On 1 September 2020, the Ministry of Statistics released the GDP figures for Q1 (April to June) FY21, which showed a contraction of 24% as compared to
                    the same period the year before. Major companies in India such as Larsen & Toubro, Bharat Forge, UltraTech Cement, Grasim Industries, Aditya Birla Group, BHEL and Tata Motors temporarily suspended or significantly reduced operations.
                    Young startups have been impacted as funding has fallen.[12][13] Fast-moving consumer goods companies in the country have significantly reduced operations and are focusing on essentials. Stock markets in India posted their worst loses
                    in history on 23 March 2020.[14] However, on 25 March, one day after a complete 21-day lockdown was announced by the Prime Minister, SENSEX and NIFTY posted their biggest gains in 11 years.

                    Globally in a poll by the 'Edelman Trust Barometer', out of the 13,200+ people polled, 67% agreed that "The government's highest priority should be saving as many lives as possible even if it means the economy will recover more slowly"; that is, life
                    should come before livelihood. For India, the poll showed a ratio of 64% to 36%, where 64% of the people agreed that saving as many lives as possible was a priority, and 36% agreed that saving jobs and restarting the economy was the
                    priority. In India the life versus livelihood debate also played out, with the government first announcing that life would be prioritized over livelihood, which later changed to an equal importance being given to life and livelihood.By
                    mid-May the center was keen to resume economic activities, while the Chief Ministers had mixed reactions. Prime Minister Modi announced the first 21 days of India's lockdown on 24 March. During this address to the nation he said, "Jaan
                    hai toh jahaan hai" (transl. Only if there is life there will be livelihood).On 11 April, in a meeting with the Chief Minister's of India, the Prime Minister said "Our mantra earlier was jaan hai toh jahaan hai but now it is jaan bhi
                    jahaan bhi (transl. Both, lives and livelihood matter equally)."On 14 April, another address to the nation was made by Modi in which he extended the lockdown, with adjustments, to 3 May.In the Prime Minister's fifth meeting with the
                    Chief Ministers on 11 May, the Prime Minister said that Indians must prepare for the post coronavirus pandemic world, just as the world changed after the world wars.[30][31] During the meeting Modi said "Jan se lekar jag tak" (transl. From
                    an individual to the whole of humanity) would be the new principle and way of life.

                    India's overall economic package was announced as ₹20 lakh crore (US$280 billion), 10% of India's GDP. The package, though announced on 12 May by the Prime Minister, included previous government actions, including the RBI announcements. The previous RBI
                    announcements included around ₹8 lakh crore (US$110 billion) liquidity. the economic package also included the Finance Minister announcement of a package totaling ₹170,000 crore (US$24 billion) on 26 March.The strategy of combining
                    fiscal and monetary, liquidity measures was defended by the government. Sitharaman explained that other countries had also done the same. Estimates of the size of India's fiscal stimulus as a percentage of GDP varied between 0.75%
                    to 1.3%. The Finance Minister, for five days, between 13 and 17 May, held press conferences in which the details of the economic package was explained. The economic package consisted of a mix of reforms, infrastructure building, support
                    to stressed businesses and a certain amount of direct cash support.[163] The "collateral-free loans" that the package provided aimed to "resume business activity and safeguard jobs". Changes in FDI policy, privatization of the power
                    sector, provident fund contribution and ease of doing business measures were also announced.Land reforms at the state level which were not mentioned in the economic package are also part of the overall changes.Reports though stated
                    the economic package did not address short term demand concerns, which may in turn pull down the economy even more; with most of the announcements being related to supply. It was also reported by economists such as Sonal Varma, Nomura
                    Global Market Research, that "long pending politically sensitive reforms" have been pushed through during this time and with this package.[167] While the economic package was criticised on various fronts, it was also given neutral
                    to positive responses on other fronts such as for the necessary caution the government showed in its spending.

                    In India up to 53% of businesses have specified a certain amount of impact of shutdowns caused due to coronavirus on operations, as per a FICCI survey in March. By 24 April the unemployment rate had increased nearly 19% within a month, reaching 26% unemployment
                    across India, according to the 'Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy'.Around 140,000,000 (14 crores) Indians lost employment during the lockdown. More than 45% households across the nation reported an income drop as compared to the
                    previous year.Various business such as hotels and airlines cut salaries and laid off employees.Revenue of transport companies such as Ola Cabs went down nearly 95% in March–April resulting in 1400 layoffs.[194] It was estimated that
                    the loss to the tourism industry will be ₹15,000 crore (US$2.1 billion) for March and April alone. CII, ASSOCHAM and FAITH estimate that a huge chunk of the workforce involved with tourism in the country faces unemployment.Live events
                    industry saw an estimated loss of ₹3,000 crore (US$420 million). A number of young startups have been impacted as funding has fallen.A DataLabs report shows a 45% decrease in the total growth-stage funding (Series A round) as compared
                    to Q4 2019. According to a KPMG report venture capital in Indian startups has fallen over 50% in Q1 2020 from Q4 2019.</br>
                    The Indian economy was expected to lose over ₹32,000 crore (US$4.5 billion) every day during the first 21 days of the lockdown, according to Acuité Ratings. Barclays said the cost of the first 21 days of shutdown as well as the previous two shorter ones
                    will total to around ₹8.5 lakh crore (US$120 billion). Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) had sought an economic fiscal stimulus package of 1% of India's GDP amounting to ₹2 lakh crore (US$28 billion).[201] The fiscal package and
                    fiscal policies approach is being compared to what has happened in other countries such as Germany, Brazil and Japan.Jefferies Group said that the government can spend ₹1.3 lakh crore (US$18 billion) to fight the impact of coronavirus.[203]
                    Bloomberg's economists say at least ₹2.15 lakh crore (US$30 billion) needs to be spent.Former CEA Arvind Subramanian said that India would need a ₹10 trillion (US$140 billion) stimulus to overcome the contraction.

                    <p>
                        India had also been witnessing a pre-pandemic slowdown.[204] Even before the pandemic, since FY 2018–19, India's growth was falling, 8% in Q4 FY18 to 4.5% in Q2 FY20. In January 2020 itself, well before India's lockdown or reactions to the pandemic, the
                        International Monetary Fund reduced India's GDP estimates for 2019 and also reduced the 2020 GDP forecast.[205] The 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation and goods and services tax enactment in 2017 led to severe back to back disruptions
                        in the economy. On top of this there had been numerous banking crises such as the Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services crisis and government scheme failures such as that of 'Make in India'.There was also a significant "income
                        crunch" for both rural and urban sectors in the year prior to the lockdown.

                    There were concerns as to where would the government find the funds to fight coronavirus and keep the economy alive.Experts suggested measures such as looking into NPA norms, tax payments and income support to those in the unorganised sectors.A direct
                    cash transfer scheme for the most vulnerable is also being considered, as has happened in other countries. On 8 April 2020, the managing director of Bajaj Auto, Rajiv Bajaj, wrote in an opinion piece in the Economic Times that the
                    "lockdown makes India weak rather than stronger in combating the epidemic," and that the current "arbitrary" lockdown was totally unsustainable and a "recalibration" is needed.Rajiv Bajaj writes that "India may have to sell itself
                    out of the coronavirus crisis". Post the economic package, Barbara Harriss-White criticised the "shock tactics" of the Modi government during the COVID-19 pandemic, the same "shock tactics" that were seen during demonetization. The
                    Press Information Bureau brought out a fact check that stories about a financial emergency being imposed in India are fake.A financial emergency has never been imposed in the history of India as yet.Numerous companies are carrying
                    out measures within their companies to ensure that staff anxiety is kept at a minimum. Hero MotoCorp has been conducting video townhall meetings, Tata Group has set up a task force to make working from home more effective and the task
                    force at Siemens also reports on the worldwide situation of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                    The contribution of the Aviation Sector and Tourism to our GDP stands at about 2.4% and 9.2% respectively. The Tourism sector served approximately 43 million people in FY 18-19. Aviation and Tourism were the first industries that were hit significantly
                    by the pandemic. The common consensus seems to be that COVID will hit these industries harder than 9/11 and the Financial Crisis of 2008. These two industries have been dealing with severe cash flow issues since the start of the pandemic
                    and are staring at a potential 38 million lay-offs, which translates to 70 per cent of the total workforce. The impact is going to fall on both, White and Blue collar jobs. According to IATO estimates, these industries may incur losses
                    of about 85 billion Rupees due to travel restrictions. The Pandemic has also brought about a wave of innovation in the fields of contactless boarding and travel technologies.
                    <div class="heading">
                        <li>There has been a significant amount of changes in the telecom sector of India even before the COVID 19 due to brief price wars between the service providers. Most essential services and sectors have continued to run during the
                            pandemic thanks to the implementation of the ‘work from home’ due to restrictions. With over 1 billion connections as of 2019, the telecom sector contributes about 6.5 per cent of GDP and employs almost 4 million people. Increased
                            broadband usage had a direct impact and resulted in pressure on the network. Demand has been increased by about 10%. However, the Telco’s are bracing for a sharp drop in adding new subscribers. As a policy recommendation, the
                            government can aid the sector by relaxing the regulatory compliances and provide moratorium for spectrum dues, which can be used for network expansions by the companies.</li>
                        </br>
                        <li>The pharmaceutical industry has been on the rise since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, especially in India, the largest producer of generic drugs globally. With a market size of $55 billion during the beginning of 2020, it
                            has been surging in India, exporting Hydroxychloroquine to the world, esp. to the US, UK, Canada, and the Middle-East. There has been a recent rise in the prices of raw materials imported from China due to the pandemic. Generic
                            drugs are the most impacted due to heavy reliance on imports, disrupted supply-chain, and labour unavailability in the industry, caused by social distancing. Simultaneously, the pharmaceutical industry is struggling because
                            of the government-imposed bans on the export of critical drugs, equipment, and PPE kits to ensure sufficient quantities for the country. The increasing demand for these drugs, coupled with hindered accessibility is making things
                            harder. Easing the financial stress on the pharmaceutical companies, tax-relaxations, and addressing the labour force shortage could be the differentiating factors in such a desperate time.</li>
                        </br>
                        <li>The Indian Oil & Gas industry is quite significant in the global context – it is the third-largest energy consumer only behind USA and Chine and contributes to 5.2% of the global oil demand. The complete lockdown across the country
                            slowed down the demand of transport fuels (accounting for 2/3rd demand in oil & gas sector) as auto & industrial manufacturing declined and goods & passenger movement (both bulk & personal) fell. Though the crude prices dipped
                            in this period, the government increased the excise and special excise duty to make up for the revenue loss, additionally, road cess was raised too. As a policy recommendation, the government may think of passing on the benefits
                            of decreased crude prices to end consumers at retail outlets to stimulate demand.</li>
