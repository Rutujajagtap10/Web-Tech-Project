                    The coronavirus outbreak is causing widespread concern and economic hardship for consumers, businesses, and communities across the globe. The ongoing lockdown has put a lot of strain on the manufacturing industry which contributes almost 20% of the GDP.
                    Almost all the industries are badly hit by the lockdown, this comes as yet another blow for the windows and doors manufacturing industry.The lockdown has made the economy handicapped with the shutters closed and is also affecting the
                    livelihood of many. The manufacturing units have already suffered a huge loss. With it, the livelihood of those associated with the industry is at stake. In this uncertain time, 90 % of the workforce has gone back to their native places,
                    leaving manufacturers in the lurch. Workers exodus has come as a double whammy to many COVID-hit Indian sectors that were already reeling under a slowing economy.As manufacturing decides on how to go about the future, post lockdown
                    the industry will also have to teach its workers the new standards expected out of them. A few precautions such as thermal sensing, sanitizing the factory, providing sanitizers to workers, establishing boundaries of social contact,
                    should be taken to keep working amidst this pandemic. All in all, the manufacturing sector should think of the long term and mould its business model accordingly.The most immediate concern currently on the minds of manufacturers is
                    cash flow and working capital. Many from this industry are recognizing that COVID19 is a wake-up call to change and improve different aspects of manufacturing operations. This pandemic came as a bolt from the blue for the manufacturing
                    sector for businesses that were digitally under-prepared. Technology is the new backbone of the manufacturing industry that wants to succeed in the post-COVID world. Digitization is no longer optional; it has become a critical need
                    in a scenario where physical interactions will continue to be extremely limited and remote access to everything will be the order of the day. The traditional market, will not be possible for a long time, so holistic e-marketplaces
                    will become an important way for manufacturers to reach out to potential customers, suppliers, and lenders to grow their business.

                    The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has started approaching a host of small and medium entities in MSME, retail, restaurants, malls and hospitality sectors as part of its latest survey to gauge the impact of the second Covid-19 wave that has further pushed
                    those businesses to the wall. RBI has mandated several banks to identify small and medium businesses in those sectors and to line up online meetings as part of the central bank’s initiatives.Participants and non-participants are equally
                    baffled by the market's resilience to Covid 2.0. In the last one month, Nifty has gained about 6%. “While this second wave is expected to impact the country’s economic recovery in the short term, we expect the economy to bounce back
                    as the government accelerates its vaccine rollout and lockdowns are getting lifted,” investment firm Franklin Templeton wrote on Tuesday.

                    As part of a critical infrastructure industry, aerospace and defense leaders must respond to the immediate crisis now while also planning for new ways of working which will emerge as COVID-19 infection cases begin to decline in the coming months.Airlines
                    are cutting immediate capacity in the range of 40 to 100 percent and asking for deferrals, model switches and cancellations on orders. Most major civil aircraft assembly plants are closed indefinitely or operating at a vastly reduced
                    volume. These lower production rates are rippling down to the supplier network as production is paused and workforces furloughed.While airlines still need to maintain parked aircraft, aftermarket revenues will be severely curtailed
                    as overhauls are deferred to conserve cash and the maintenance mainstay hourly contracts track schedule and capacity downwards. As airlines make decisions on retiring models and reassess their fleet needs, aircraft production and aftermarket
                    services will need to be fundamentally reassessed to account for long-term demand shifts.Defense markets – and their dependent supply networks — remain strong from a demand perspective, with governments easing procurement processes
                    and offering better payment terms. Even though deemed as a critical infrastructure industry status in many countries, defense contractors across the globe are facing lockdowns. However, the ability to maintain program schedules and
                    production rates are hampered by the dual challenges of managing a highly skilled but now remote workforce while ensuring the safety of on-site workers. While most defense production sites are operational, local conditions are causing
                    closures across the globe.

                    Since OEMs rely heavily on just-in-time production, their supply chains were immediately disrupted. In China, almost two-thirds of auto production was directly affected by the country’s industrial shutdown, which had a large impact on their suppliers
                    as well1. Furthermore, the shortage of Chinese-made parts has had a heavy impact on global production.Could COVID-19 be the black swan event that finally forces many companies, and entire industries, to rethink and transform their
                    global supply chain model? One fact is beyond doubt: It has already exposed the vulnerabilities of many organizations, especially those who have a high dependence on China to fulfil their need for raw materials or finished products.China’s
                    dominant role as the “world’s factory” means that any major disruption puts global supply chains at risk. Highlighting this is the fact that more than 200 of the Fortune Global 500 firms have a presence in Wuhan, the highly industrialized
                    province where the outbreak originated, and which has been hardest hit. Companies whose supply chain is reliant on Tier 1 (direct) or Tier 2 (secondary) suppliers in China are likely to experience significant disruption, even if, according
                    to the most optimistic reports, conditions approach normalcy in China by April.

                        1)Evaluate the risks and create full transparency by using big data, intelligent systems and connected ecosystems. This communicates shortages or other challenges to all points along the supply chain so they can prepare, adapt or adjust accordingly.<br>                        2)Mobilize a command center to orchestrate the response and configure the risk response. And all the while, operate with agility.<br> 3)After the crisis, operate risk mitigation as usual: integrate risk mitigation workflows, scenarios
                        and (response) protocols into daily operations to quickly switch from normal to disruption response if needed.<br>

                    While the situation in China is starting to stabilize5, most of the US and European car manufacturing is under huge uncertainty on when plants will resume normal production. At the same time, OEMs are starting to shift engineering, assembly and even procurement
                    capacities to produce and source medical equipment. Regardless of whether the halts are required by health and safety enforcement, legislative inaction, declining demand or a lack of parts in the supply chain, the consequences remain
                    the same: job losses, a predicted drop of 16 percent6 for the automotive production and hence, a severe impact to GDP.

                        safety, allowing for physical distancing and hiring specialized cleaning companies.<br> 3)Embrace Industrial-IoT-concepts to increase efficiency and prepare (future) shock protocols.<br> 4)Establish manufacturing resilience to

                    China is still the world’s largest market for light vehicles. The sales drop in February 2020 of more than 80 percent2 in comparison to January is a strong indicator of the direction the global market is heading, and the impact is already visible. Forecasts
                    for global light vehicle sales in all major regions predict that the market will drop by around 12 percent3 in 2020, and it is very unlikely that these circumstances will change soon. Sales forecasts for the US estimate a decline of
                    9 percent4 annually that consumers are not buying new vehicles due to the pandemic. Changes in customer behavior in response to being on “lockdown,” such as less mobility and more online shopping, might remain after the crisis passes.

                    All industries are affected by COVID-19, but Communications and Media companies are generally well positioned. They are mobilizing to adapt to demand changes and will play a critical role in supporting governments, consumers and businesses during the
                    uncertain times ahead.As lockdowns have been imposed across the globe in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers have turned in huge numbers to digital channels for entertainment, information, education, and to stay in touch with
                    family and friends. In combination with the rapid move for many to working from home, it's led to a whole new emphasis on the importance of the offerings that media companies and communications service providers (CSPs) deliver.As the
                    world enters a new phase, we wanted to find out how consumers have assessed providers during the pandemic, and what they might look for in the future. To do that, we surveyed more than 4400 consumers located in 12 countries across
                    5 continents.Explore how, in their response to the early days of the pandemic, Communications and Media companies have built trust by playing an integral role in consumers' wellbeing, their ability to keep in touch with family and
                    friends and stay productive in their work.

                        With COVID-19, the time to act is now. Deferred decisions and delayed actions have immediate and longer-term business consequences. To minimize business disruption, protect employees and serve customers, Communications and Media organizations must take
                        steps to be able to dynamically adapt to rapidly changing consumer and business needs, and global and local conditions.
