                    C2SMART researchers are collecting and processing transportation datasets from various sources in both New York and Seattle to quantify the reduction in travel in both cities due to stay-at-home orders. The white paper above shows preliminary results
                    from New York data. Findings include:
                    <div class="heading">
                        <li>Traffic volumes and travel times have dropped dramatically, and system usage is well below system capacity.</li>
                        <li>Commuting activity from the suburbs to New York City has drastically decreased.</li>
                        <li>A reduction in crashes, as well as a temporary mode shift to bicycling.</li>

                        Researchers will continue to track data in near real-time based on guidance and directives from governments in both cities. This work will identify differences between local population reactions to the pandemic and also population response to government
                        directives in different timescales, providing better data to plan for potential future scenarios

                    The pandemic and resulting stay-at-home orders are also affecting the shipping and movement of goods. C2SMART is tracking truck volumes and weights from weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems installed on its Urban Roadway Testbed on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway
                    (BQE) to observe the pandemic effects on trucks moving through New York City. Preliminary data show:
                    <div class="heading">
                        <li>After 3/13, total traffic dropped by 30% for the rest of March. However, truck traffic appears to have dropped less than all traffic with a reduction of only 15%.</li>
                        <li>The reduction in number of trips has increased average vehicle speeds by 11% to 24%.</li>
                        <li>WIM data does not show a large change to GVWs; however, the number of heavy trucks (>80 kips) as well as the maximum GVW appear to have gone down: 20% reduction for Queens Bound trips and 14% reduction for Staten Island Bound trips–there
                            are fewer trips carrier lighter than normal loads.</li>
                        C2SMART, together with its partners at the Intercep Center for Emergency Preparedness, are planning to launch an Emergency Logistics Innovation Task Force to ensure effective supply of essential medical supplies and food to the Metropolitan New York region
                        during the COVID-19 crisis. It will take advantage of Intercep’s established Metropolitan Resilience Network of government and private companies to shift focus away from preparedness to reaction to the crisis. Its objectives are
                        to:
                        <li>Develop results-oriented approaches beyond traditional constraints.</li>
                        <li>Enable fast paced adaptation to the changing operating environment.</li>
                        <li>Develop effective strategies immediately actionable in the current environment.</li>
                        <li>Build/coordinate relationships and resources necessary to enable implementation.</li>

                    One of the biggest immediate issues for shipping companies during the pandemic has been the inability to change crews, which is essential to ensure safety, crew health, and welfare. Port, border and travel restrictions have led crewmembers to extend their
                    service on board ships, unable to return to homes and family. Most major ports have imposed restrictions on vessels and crew, 120 countries implemented restrictions, while 92 prohibited crew changes entirely, according to data from
                    Inchcape Shipping Services. Extended periods of working on board a vessel can lead to crew fatigue, which is known to be one of the underlying causes of human error; it is estimated to be a contributing factor in 75% to 96% of marine
                    incidents. ITF Coordinator for the Arab World region and Iran network Mohammad Arrachedi has reported that the number of cases and seafarers requests for ITF’s assistance has significantly and evidently increased during 2020, if compared
                    to 2019. Seafarers’ complaints are very often related to unpaid wages, medical assistance, repatriation and other aspects related to wellbeing in general. "This year, the impact of Covid 19 on the seafarers is so negative and resulted
                    in hundreds of seafarers stuck on board of the ships. Despite the expiry of their employment contracts, they are obliged to remain on board due to the Travel restrictions taken by the governments as part of their measurements against
                    Covid 19. Seafarers were obviously victims to Employers who found the perfect excuses to escape from any liabilities towards repatriating their crew".

                    The shipping industry has largely proved resilient to the Covid 19 outbreak.Despite the current difficult times, a vast majority of ports have succeeded to stay open to cargo operations. However, most of them still remain closed to passenger traffic.
                    Despite the disruptions at ports and to crew changes the shipping industry has largely continued to operate around the world, facilitating the movement of essential supplies and medicines that are needed to keep countries running and
                    to deal with the global public health crisis.

                    The road transport sector is essential to social and economic development and guarantees mobility across countries. Road freight transport services ensure the supply of essential goods, including food and medical supplies, as well as a vast range of materials
                    upon which businesses and consumers depend. The road transport sector not only makes an important contribution to economic growth and job creation, but also prevents shortages of essential goods. Road transport in some countries has
                    been declared an essential service. In order to control the spread of COVID-19, many countries around the world have placed restrictions on domestic transit and/or closed border crossings for road freight transport services. The resulting
                    downturn in trade and supply chain disruptions will have an impact in all countries, and may further heighten the vulnerability of landlocked developing countries. Shortages of essential goods or higher prices can affect the most vulnerable
                    in society (including women, the elderly and informal workers). Urgent action by governments, the social partners and parties to road transport supply chains – including shippers, receivers, and transport buyers– will be critical in
                    addressing decent work challenges for these key workers to tackle the present and future crises effectively.

                    During the first wave of Covid 19, the demand on oil has significantly dropped to more than 50% due to the closure that the world has witnessed. The pandemic has impacted public transport dramatically in general and ways of mobility specifically, as the
                    new regulations that have been put in place interfered with the number of passengers using public transportation. The number of passengers entering public transportation waiting stops is so limited, sharing taxies is prohibited, and
                    installing protective screens between driver and passenger became necessary. Covid 19 has put many obstacles in the way of public transport agencies and its workers. Thus, these companies find themselves incapable of paying drivers
                    their wages, finance their commitments, and secure the operational expenses. Our World in Data, represents data and research on how the pandemic has change the movement of people around the world. The number of visitors to transit
                    stations in the Arab World has changed dramatically since the beginning of the pandemic. The chart below illustrates the huge drop down on public transportation demand due to the closure that the governments have imposed on their citizens
                    to curb the Corona Virus from spreading
