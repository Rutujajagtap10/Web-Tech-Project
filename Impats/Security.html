                        Pandemics are for the most part disease outbreaks that become widespread as a result of the spread of human-to-human infection.1 Beyond the debilitating, sometimes fatal, consequences for those directly affected, pandemics have a range of negative social, economic and political consequences. These tend 
                        to be greater where the pandemic is a novel pathogen, has a high mortality and/or hospitalization rate and is easily spread. According to Lee Jong-wook, former Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), pandemics do not respect international borders.2 Therefore, they have the potential to 
                        weaken many societies, political systems and economies simultaneously.
                        The association of pandemics with national security threat grew to prominence in the1990s. In 1995, the World Health Assembly (WHA) agreed to revise the International Health Regulations (IHR), the only international legal framework governing how WHO and its member States should respond to infectious disease 
                        outbreaks, on the grounds that revision was needed to take “effective account of the threat posed by the international spread of new and re-emerging diseases”.3 In 2005, the IHR revisions were adopted as WHA Resolution 58.3.4 Article 2 announced that the scope and purpose of the instrument was “to prevent, protect 
                        against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks”.5  Since its entry into force in 2007, signatory States have been working, individually and collectively, to meet their core capacity requirements under the new framework.
                        The focus of IHR is on the prevention and containment of public health emergencies of international concern. Member States committed themselves to building core capacities in the areas of national legislation, policy and financing, coordination and National Focal Point (NFP) communications, surveillance, response, preparedness, risk communication, 
                        and human resources and laboratories. It was widely presumed that not all member States would achieve these eight capacities by the 1 July 2012 deadline, but those that could not would identify areas in which they needed assistance in order to achieve these capacities.
                        The political logic behind the attachment of health to security within the IHR framework would underline their importance and help sustain the political will needed to achieve the core capacities. The global threat posed by pandemics required a global approach to security as the rapid transmission of disease in a globalized world means that 
                        capacity failures in any member State could place any other state or society in peril. By 2013, 110 member States out of 195 signatories requested an additional two-year extension to build the capacities. This unexpectedly large number could be interpreted in one of two ways. First, that member States are not taking their commitment seriously and that 
                        the use of security language in the health field is no more than rhetoric. Second, that most states face immense challenges when it comes to building core capacities, especially when domestic health systems are fragmented, inadequately funded and understaffed

                                The first way in which global pandemics can threaten state security is at the domestic level, where internal societal disruption can threaten states at the most fundamental level. IDs pose an “exogenous threat to the people of a state” (McInnes 2008: 279) as the potential for loss of human life challenges 
                                the core purpose of any state – to protect it’s citizens. Moreover, globalisation has led to increased movement of people and goods which facilitates rapid travel of IDs (Curley & Herington 2011), suggesting that IDs originating in developing countries now pose a direct threat to Western populations.
                                A host of potential risks are associated with an ID outbreak, including: a lack of confidence in a state that cannot provide satisfactory healthcare, the exaggeration of social inequalities brought on by unequal access to healthcare, and the inability to maintain public services as workers are ill 
                                or do not turn up to work. (McInnes 2008: 279). At best, these threaten the credibility of the government, at worst they act as catalysts for internal violence as dissatisfied groups with little to lose take action. Using the example of HIV/AIDS, Susan Peterson identifies the social impact of IDs 
                                to be the greatest threat to state security, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa (2002). HIV/AIDS not only threatens the state in the direct ways suggesting by McInnes, but impacts on family life as “bread-winners sicken and die, health care and burial costs mount, savings are depleted, surviving children 
                                leave school to work or care for sick relatives, food consumption drops, malnutrition and poverty worsen, and medical expenses soar” (Peterson 2002: 58). Because the disease disproportionally affects the middle aged, a generation of desperate orphans are left who will increasingly be forced into 
                                crime and violence as a means of survival, especially as the disease ravages the education system (Peterson 2002), indirectly threatening internal stability.</br>
                                Global pandemics can be seen to threaten internal state stability directly and indirectly, with consequences that initially impact on families and communities, but can rapidly spread to a scale that challenges state legitimacy. There is a close relationship between public health and internal state 
                                stability (McInnes & Lee 2006), and a “growing realization that national security depends in great measure on domestic stability” (Alleyne 1996: 159, in Peterson 2002: 58). It is likely that internal societal problems will have a knock on effect on the economy, which will now be assessed.

                                The third way in which global pandemics can threaten state security is by having an adverse impact on military effectiveness. HIV/AIDS rates in the military are phenomenally high in many Sub-Saharan African states, with HIV infection in Malawi and Zimbabwe estimated “to be in the order 
                                of 75-80 per cent, and elements of the South African military believed to be perhaps 90 per cent” (McInnes 2008: 279). This is particularly problematic in the military where experienced ‘middle managers’ with specialist technical knowledge are at the highest risk of death from HIV/AIDS. 
                                Furthermore, “armed forces in severely affected states will be unable to recruit and train soldiers quickly enough to replace their sick and dying colleagues, the potential recruitment pool itself will dwindle, and officers corps will be decimated. Military budgets will be sapped, military 
                                blood supplies will be tainted, and organizational structures strained to accommodate unproductive soldiers” (Peterson 2002: 77). Not only do IDs have the potential to devastate military structures, but reduced troop morale and dwindling numbers could be even more damaging in the long term.</br>
                                There is also evidence to suggest that violent conflict accelerates the spread of IDs. During conflict soldiers are willing to “engage in even more risky behaviour” (McInnes 200: 281), leading to increased rates of sex – through rape and/or prostitution – that can spread IDs. Increased levels 
                                of migration during times of conflict can facilitate the spread of IDs, and returning soldiers may also spread infection (NIE 2000). Whilst none of these factors is likely to directly shape the outcome of war, it is likely they will have longer term implications for state security. As the risk of
                                military personnel contracting HIV “is as much as 100 times that of the civilian risk” (Peterson 2002: 77) states may become unwilling to accept peacekeeping forces with high HIV/AIDS rates for fear of further spreading the disease. This is particularly problematic in Sub-Saharan Africa where the 
                                “top 10 contributory nations to peacekeeping operations include states with high HIV prevalence rates (such as Kenya, Nigeria and Ghana)” (UNAIDS 2003, in McInnes 2008: 280). Whilst violent conflict can accelerate the spread of IDs, IDs may also decelerate conflict resolution.

                            National security—in its traditional sense—is associated with the protection of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of a state, as well as its critical interests abroad. However, the lethal nature of pandemics is increasingly raising scientific awareness about their national security 
                            dimensions. To this end, National Academies Press1 observes that ‘national security is not just about protection from state and non-state actors, but also encompasses protection from emerging infectious diseases and other health outcomes that can threaten a nation’s economic vitality and its 
                            very way of life’. As Evans2 would want us to accept, ‘emerging diseases and their pandemic potential pose perhaps an even greater national security threat, particularly in this era of globalization when disease can spread more rapidly than in previous eras’. The ‘frontliners’ here, as might 
                            be expected, are the human security experts and practitioners who view catastrophic infectious diseases as security concerns because of their destructive and disruptive ability.3 As will be demonstrated later, diseases threaten national security in different ways. First, they are responsible 
                            for considerable morbidity and mortality in human populations. Second, lack of pandemic preparedness could increase the vulnerability of a state to bioterrorism and the associated consequences/emergencies. Third, infectious diseases could limit the ability of the armed forces to respond adequately to internal and external security threats.4
                            From the lessons of history, the outbreak of infectious diseases—that could reach pandemic levels—is always a possibility and human societies have been living with this possibility for generations.5 As explained by Peterson,6
                            Human history is replete with stories of epidemic infections. These epidemics tend to follow a cyclical pattern, since they often produce immunity in survivors, and the microbes must await a new generation of hosts to infect. Alternatively, the disease-causing microbes migrate to geographically 
                            distant and immunologically vulnerable populations, producing a pandemic, or global outbreak.It is clear that infectious diseases have always produced a significant impact on global epidemiology. For illustrative purposes, the Russian Flu (1889–1890), Spanish Flu (1918–1919), Asian Flu (1957–1958), 
                            Hong Kong Flu (1968–1970), and Swine Flu (2009–2010) together killed almost 60 million people. The Spanish Flu alone claimed about 50 million lives. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) which began in 1981 has killed over 25 million people worldwide.
                            Little wonder, authors have contended that pandemics have emerged as direct threats to national security and would produce a more telling impact on the globe in the next decade.8 Even though the possibility of a pandemic emphasizes the need for pandemic preparedness, national leaders have always neglected 
                            this reality as interventionist measures have been largely reactionary.The novel coronavirus (now known as COVID-19) erupted in the capital of China’s Hubei province—Wuhan—in November 2019.9 The virus has now spread to different regions of the world as about 190 countries have recorded cases of infection. 
                            At the last count, while the total number of worldwide confirmed cases stands as 2,979,353, the number of fatalities stands as 206,240 in just over four months. With figures of almost one million infections and more than 55,000 fatalities, the United States is currently the epicentre of the disease. The United States 
                            is followed by five countries: Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Together, these five European countries have close to 900,000 confirmed cases with more than 99,000 deaths. The Asian continent has about 470,000 infections and 17,200 fatalities, South America has 135,000 infections and 6,100 deaths, 
                            the African region has a total of 32,400 infections and 1,400 deaths, and Oceania has 8,280 confirmed cases and 100 deaths.10 The worldwide mass containment measures notwithstanding, the figures have continued to rise. Also, the fact that the major powers in the world are the worst affected says much about their unpreparedness 
                            for global pandemic challenges. Since COVID-19 deaths are not from a bomb or a missile, the daily rise in the number of fatalities reminds us that infectious diseases remain a major killer and can easily kill more people than a war.11 An infectious disease that could cross the shores of a country, infect its citizens, and leave 
                            in its wake considerable morbidity and mortality surely constitutes a major threat to national security.
                            More so, the worldwide spread of the virus has disrupted the major globalizing processes. It has not only plummeted 21st century civilization—with all its advancements and might, it has also left leaders and citizens wounded.12 International travel and migration have greatly receded as major terminals in the world remain deserted. Several 
                            international sporting activities and events have either been cancelled or rescheduled. The global economy could also be heading towards a recession of unimaginable proportions. Already, there are very large job losses in the so-called advanced economies and the citizens of poor countries are enduring hunger and starvation.13 While harping 
                            on the security implications of the ravaging coronavirus, the United Nations’ Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, correctly observes that the disease could lead to opportunistic terror attacks, social/political unrest and violence, and erosion of trust in public institutions.14 In the United Kingdom, counter-terrorism personnel are anticip
                            a rise in terrorist recruits after a collapse in referrals to the country’s anti-radicalization body due to national lockdown.

                            The restrictions imposed by governments in response to the coronavirus pandemic have encouraged employees to work from home, and even ‘stay at home’. As a consequence, technology has become even more important in both our working and personal lives. Despite this rise of technology need, it is noticable that many organisations 
                            still do not provide a ’cyber-safe’ remote-working environment. Where business meetings have traditionally been held in-person, most now take place virtually.
                            In June 2020 Swissinfo.ch reported figures from the NCSC (National Cyber Security Center) showing that there were 350 reported cases of cyberattacks (phishing, fraudulent web sites, direct attacks on companies etc.) in Switzerland in April, compared to the norm of 100-150. The coronavirus pandemic 
                            and increase in working from home were seen as a major cause of this increase, since individuals working at home do not enjoy the same level of inherent protection/deterrent measures from a working environment (e.g. internet security).

                                    An example of criminals exploiting the cybersecurity weaknesses in remote working has been the series of cyberattacks on video conferencing services. Between February 2020 and May 2020 more than half a million people 
                                    were affected by breaches in which the personal data of video conferencing services users (e.g., name, passwords, email addresses) was stolen and sold on the dark web. To execute this attack, some hackers used a tool called ‘OpenBullet’.
                                    Hackers also use credential stuffing techniques to gain access to employees’ credentials and the stolen data is then sold to other cybersecurity criminals. One of the consequences is a serious disruption to businesses that rely heavily 
                                    on videoconferencing platforms. Credential stuffing is a form of cyberattack whereby hackers use previously-stolen combinations of username and password to gain access to other accounts. This is possible because it is very common for individuals 
                                    to use the same username/password combination across multiple accounts.</br>
                                    We noted instances where unwanted and uninvited members gain access to virtual meetings and obtain confidential or sensitive information, which is then sold to another party or made available to the public to damage the company’s reputation.

                                        It appears that many hackers are upping their game, and to capitalize on the new shift by companies to remote working, 
                                        they have developed new malware to attack and infiltrate systems.Prior to the pandemic, about 20% of cyberattacks used previously unseen malware or methods. During the pandemic, the proportion has risen to 35%. Some 
                                        of the new attacks use a form of machine learning that adapts to its environment and remains undetected. As an example, phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated and using different channels such as SMS and voice 
                                        (vishing). Moreover, news about vaccine developments is used for phishing campaigns. Ransomware attacks are also becoming more sophisticated. For example, hackers are combining data leakage attacks with ransomware to 
                                        persuade victims to pay the ransom.This upsurge in sophisticated cyberattacks calls for new ‘cutting edge’ detection mechanisms to meet the threat, such as ‘user and entity behavior analysis’ or UEBA. This analyzes the 
                                        normal conduct of users, and applies this knowledge to detect instances where anomalous deviations from normal patterns occur.

                                        COVID-19 is putting hard security threats between nations back into the spotlight. The geopolitical rivalry between the great powers is likely to worsen as the American and Chinese economies become less interdependent. 
                                        The next tier of major powers poses risks as well. Europe has been hit hard by the virus, once again fraying ties between the Eurozone’s stronger and weaker economies.
                                        At the same time, the fragility agenda that got underway during the 1990s and 2000s is going global. In the past few years, the World Bank and United Nations have converged on an analysis where violent conflict is 
                                        driven by a combination of failing government institutions and the grievances that fester when groups feel excluded and neglected. As the pandemic and ensuing economic crisis unfold, these conditions will increasingly 
                                        be found in many, if not most, countries in the world. This is not an agenda limited to poor countries at war, but is much broader and more insidious.
                                        At the very least, the risks of violence will rise in the most vulnerable countries and cities. Keen not to let a good crisis go to waste, armed groups, terrorists and organized criminals are already exploiting the 
                                        pandemic. They will find further opportunities - including in cyberspace - once bailout packages begin to flow. Violence against women and human rights abuses have already spiked – both of which are harbingers of other 
                                        forms of violence. This is set to intensify as at least 1.5 billion children and young people are sent home from their schools and universities. Many will be angry as they lose opportunities and a minority will convert 
                                        this anger toward more dangerous purposes.
